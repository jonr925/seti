01 - The app opens directly to the star map.
02 - Tapping on one of the blue dots (which indicate where we have data), will bring up information about that dot. We can discuss what information gets displayed here. I'd like to find a way to make it a little more "human" because the coordinates alone are rather geeky and don't mean much to most people. Clicking on "Explore" will take you to the Data Visualization mode.
03 - The data vis. mode. The scroll area along the bottom lets you pan across the data and also gives you a view of where there is already marked spots. Click on "Mark Area" will bring up the interface to select a region you think may be of interest. We should put our heads together and come up with a better wording than "Mark Area". We might actually want to consider a little tutorial when they switch to the Data Vis. mode for the first time.
04 - The data visualization scrolled to an area where something has already been marked. It uses transparency to indicate how frequent/important this area is. These areas line up with the blue lines on the scroll bar.
05 - Presenting the option to sign in with Facebook or a SETI account. This would only be triggered when the user does something that requires sign-in, like wanting to mark an area. If the user selects Facebook, it would take them to the page you already have in the app.
06 - If the user selects SETI, it would bring them to this screen where they can sign in. I know this probably won't be working for TED, so we can discuss the logistics behind it more. 
07- The interface for selecting an interesting area. It uses two touch points to let you draw a rectangle of any size.
08 - Rotating your fingers while selecting would also allow for rotation of the selection area so you can highlight more precisely. When you have your selection in the position you want, you can hit the Complete button.
09 - When completed, the selection shows up on the screen just like the ones previously seen.
